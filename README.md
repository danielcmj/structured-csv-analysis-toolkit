# Sensor Data Analysis Pipeline (Python)

This repository contains a Python-based analysis pipeline developed to process and analyze large sets of experimental measurement files in a consistent and reproducible way.

The project was created during an investigation focused on **optimizing a magnetic sensor**, where many measurement runs needed to be compared across samples, configurations, and operating conditions.

## Background and Motivation

During the investigation, electrical signals were collected from multiple sensor structures while performing controlled angular sweeps.  
The main analytical goal was to **convert electrical signals into angular information** and evaluate how accurately and stably the sensor reproduced the applied angle.

Key challenges included:
- handling many CSV/TXT files at once,
- grouping data by sample and configuration,
- extracting meaningful metrics from noisy experimental signals,
- identifying performance patterns using metadata.

This pipeline was designed as a reusable template to solve those problems in a structured way.

## Analysis Workflow

The analysis follows a consistent workflow:

1. **Batch loading of measurement files**  
   Files are loaded recursively using a defined folder and filename convention. Metadata (sample, configuration, measurement type, etc.) is extracted directly from file and folder names.

2. **Signal transformation**  
   Electrical signals are combined using a sin/cos ratio and transformed into angular information via an arctangent-based computation.  
   The resulting angle is unwrapped and expressed in degrees.

3. **Validation and error analysis**  
   The computed angle is compared against the applied reference angle (`x = y`), and the **angular deviation** is evaluated over full rotational sweeps.

4. **Statistical quality checks**  
   Statistical analysis is applied to assess signal balance and symmetry, including checks of Wheatstone bridge imbalance using distribution-based metrics.

5. **Metadata-driven grouping**  
   Metadata tags allow samples to be grouped and analyzed in different ways, making it possible to identify trends related to configuration, geometry, or processing conditions.

Representative plots generated by this workflow are included in `docs/figures/`.

## What This Repository Demonstrates

- Scalable analysis of many measurement files at once  
- Metadata-based grouping and filtering  
- Feature engineering from raw electrical signals  
- Angle reconstruction and error analysis  
- Use of statistics to assess signal quality and stability  
- Reproducible, modular analysis code suitable for experimental data

Although the original application involved sensor optimization, the pipeline structure is generic and applicable to other experimental or industrial data analysis problems.

## Data Confidentiality

Raw measurement data is **not included** in this repository.

The datasets used during development are proprietary.  
This project focuses on the **analysis methodology, workflow, and code structure**, rather than on the data itself.
